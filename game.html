<h3>welcome to the game page.</h3>

<p>Here is the first game that i have created. I don't have much experience with coding. Hence, i decided to use scratch which has block coding to help me with the basics of coding before i explore more options with coding.<br>below is a embedded link of the game that i had created took inspiration from flappy birds and a scenario that i had created in my secondary school with a classmate.<br>Hope you guys enjoy this. <br> ps:<pre> dont even attempt to get more than 10 it is not possible. </pre></p>
